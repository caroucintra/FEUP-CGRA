## TP 2 Notes


- In all exercises we couldn't figure out how to put the transformations of the matrixes in classes other than MyScene, therefor we did the same as before, creating the objects using vertices in different classes, while keeping the transformations in MyScene. Although the transformations should be correct as seen on the display, we understand that it is not a clean code.
- In exercise 3 we observed that it is a lot more difficult to do transformations on all quads for them to look like a cube than it was on exercise 2.
